# Progress Update 1
### Summary:
very unfinished but the world space canvas was set up, and there is camera transitions between each menu position. when you click on settings button the camera moves to the settings view (takes about a second)
### Issues:
most of the buttons are too small, not very appealing to look at
buttons need to be more UX friendly, they look too much like panels and not like buttons
